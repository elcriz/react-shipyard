# React Shipyard

Shipyard is a collection of ready to use, accessible, semantically correct React components.

All components in this collection were designed with the following in mind. They must be:

1. Accessible and usable in all browsers and on all devices, no matter the controls
2. Semantically correct, respecting web standards
3. Styled using the BEM naming convention
4. Easily customizable with own props and styling
5. Fully documented, with styling guidelines

## Installation

Whatever comes before `aplha`, and then even ten times as much before that, this is what React Shipyard is currently in. Information on how to install will be added to this README.md soon.
