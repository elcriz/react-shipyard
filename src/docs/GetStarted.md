### Using the library without React

This collection contains ready to use React components which are easy to implement in your own React projects. However, since all of the components are rendered with semantically correct, BEM named (in terms of the CSS classnames ) elements in them, you can also use the BEM components in your 'regular HTML' projects. Just point to the main stylesheet (`main.css`) and you are ready to go. I aim to add 'regular HTML' code examples to these docs as well, so please bear with me.
