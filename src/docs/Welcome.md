## Shipyard is a collection of ready to use, accessible, semantically correct React components.

All components were designed with the following in mind. They must be:

1. Accessible and usable in all browsers and on all devices, no matter the controls
2. Semantically correct, respecting web standards
3. Styled using the BEM naming convention
4. Easily customizable with own props and styling
5. Fully documented, with styling guidelines

The documentation for each component contains style guide guidelines, information on which props to use and code examples. Wait no longer, and [get started](/#/Getting%20Started) using Shipyard's components or [learn more](/#/About) about Shipyard's background.
