## Shipyard is a collection of ready to use, accessible, semantically correct React components.

All components were designed with the following in mind. They must be:

1. **Accessible and usable** in all browsers and on all devices, no matter the controls
2. Respecting HTML5 **web standards and semantics**
3. Styled using the **BEM naming convention**
4. **Easily customizable** with own props and styling
5. **Fully tested and documented**, with styling guidelines

The documentation for each component contains style guide guidelines, information on which props to use and code examples. Wait no longer, and [get started](/#/Getting%20Started) using Shipyard's components or [learn more](/#/About) about Shipyard's background.

You can find Shipyard's repository on GitHub: https://github.com/elcriz/react-shipyard.
