### About the author (and his love for plain HTML & CSS)

Shipyard was originally created by [Christiaan Hemerik](http://www.christiaanhemerik.com), a front-end developer with a strong emphasis on design and accessibility who currently works at [The Learning Network](https://www.thelearningnetwork.nl), the Netherlands' largest provider of school and study books and other learning materials.

Christiaan loves working with React and JavaScript in general, but thinks UI components should be usable in plain HTML as well. That's the reason why all components in Shipyard's collection are styled using the BEM naming convention. This allows developers and designers of other teams to use the UI components (basically the output of `render()`) as well, without getting lost in automatically generated CSS class names which have no semantic meaning.

Or remember that state-of-the-art `SelectField` component which was actually just a bunch of `<div />`s, looking all fancy on your screen but not accessible to your keyboard at all? You won't find that in Shipyard's components - guaranteed.

### Credits

Many of the components in Shipyard's collection are based on [Harbour](https://github.com/AanZee/harbour), an open source UI library, created and maintained by my former employer [Aan Zee](http://www.aanzee.nl). Harbour consists of powerful, easily customizable and accessible SCSS components implementing the BEM naming convention. Shipyard's components were also designed respecting these [conventions](https://github.com/AanZee/conventions).

Shipyard's author:
> "Already having a keen knowlegde on the use of web standards based HTML and CSS, whilst working at Aan Zee, I helped maintaining Harbour and I learned a lot more from the best experts in the industry. In my opinion, this library reflects that."
